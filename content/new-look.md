Thanks to a design donation by [Labyrinthos](https://labyrinthos.co/), I was able to implement a new, more cerulean look for [freenatalchart.xyz](https://freenatalchart.xyz).

<!-- more -->


Check out the [pull](https://github.com/lfborjas/freenatalchart.xyz/pull/32) [requests](https://github.com/lfborjas/freenatalchart.xyz/pull/33)--the former
of which is a bit messy, as some of the upcoming work for [Transits](https://github.com/lfborjas/freenatalchart.xyz/issues/1) got tangled in there.

To share the CSS between the main site and this blog, and to have a slightly more modern frontend development experience, I broke out the styles to
another free repository, [Firmament](https://github.com/natal-chart/firmament). The current incarnation of that doesn't do much justice to [Spectre](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre),
which is the project upon which it is based, but it does the job!
