Last week, on 10/17 we soft-launched <https://freenatalchart.xyz>! My wife, who runs <https://labyrinthos.co> included it in a newsletter, and we've had 1.6K querents since. 

It's quite cool to see insights in Algolia (our location search provider,) and Heroku (our hosting provider,) and see that most responses are quite snappy (~2 seconds, and it's probably because we're using the cheapest option) and there have been no crashes! This speaks to the maintainability of Haskell.
